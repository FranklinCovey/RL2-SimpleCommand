Some helper classes for building complex commands with RobotLegs 2.

h1. Usage

Batch commands should extend SimpleBatchCommand. It's children commands should extend SimpleCommand.

Each SimpleCommand requires a call to the commandComplete() method, which informs the parent batch command that the child is complete. 

Please see the "RobotLegs framework":http://www.robotlegs.org for more info.

These classes were compiled to work with RobotLegs v2.0.0.
