INSTALLATION
This distribution of Robotlegs AS3 Modular Utility is distributed with the binary SWC file (@releasename@.swc).
The SWC file should be enough to get started. Simply drop it in your projects libs folder (or wherever you keep 
external libraries) and you will have access to the fully functioning framework. 

BUILDING
In addition to the SWC file in this distribution package, the Robotlegs AS3 Modular Utility v@rlmodularversion@ source code
is also provided. This source code is dependent on the Robotlegs @rlversion@ library to function properly.
This library can be found at: @rlprojectlink@

If you would prefer to build from the source, it is highly recommended that you download the Robotlegs AS3 Modular Utility
project in its entirety. This project contains all of the required libraries and ANT build scripts to generate SWC
files of the framework. This project can be found at: @rlmodularprojectlink@

USAGE
Please refer to the Best Practices documentation for an introduction to using the Robotlegs AS3 Micro-Architecture. 
Additionally there is a knowledge base/FAQ where you can ask questions and receive support.
